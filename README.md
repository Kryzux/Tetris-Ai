Essentially it's just a goofy tetris that I made

Keybinds:
Up- Rotates the piece
Down- Speeds up the descent
Left/Right- Move the piece side to side
Space- Instantly place the current piece
c- Hold a piece
a- Toggle for the Ai (It is progressive learning, so give it like 3 minutes to get good at the game)
+ Increase the Ai's speed (Yes you have to hold shift and plus)
- Decrease the Ai's speed
